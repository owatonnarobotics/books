# Docs
Dear reader,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This documentation is intended to be the most comprehensive guide to programming in FRC I can produce. For the past four years, I have lived and breathed WPILib. This documentation will not focus on just code; it will cover almost everything I have learned related to the control system. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a centralized source of information that you might not find anywhere else. In addition, hopefully this documentation helps with cutting down the hunting for obscure PDFs online. This includes everything from the CAN bus to Git to limit switches. It is hard to convey how much I have learned about the control system in FRC, from official documentation, unofficial documentation, trial and error, failure, and most importantly, the programming leads before me. If I have learned anything in my FIRST career as a student, it is that with dedication and experimentation for the subject, one can excell. A large portion of what I have learned about the FRC control system cam from experimentation. I would encourage the reader to venture into the unknown; build some sketchy code and deploy itâ€”just make sure the robot is on stilts first :).\
Sincerely,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dylan-meiners


## Layout
Please do not be scared away from the length of these docs. These docs are meant to be a resource, so that if any problem arises or if you want to learn more about a subject, you can. It is not recommended to read all of these sections one after another like a novel. It would be recommended to read one section at a time, experiment with the things in the section you read, and read another section when you feel ready.

### Sections

2. [Hardware](hardware.md) (yes, this is programming team)
3. National Instruments FRC Game Tools
4. Competition Matches & FMS
5. The WPILib Development Environment
