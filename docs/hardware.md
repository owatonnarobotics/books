# Hardware
Now, you might be asking, "why should I, a programmer, need to know how many amps a Falcon 500 draws?" The answer is simple: your code interacts *directly* with the hardware. If you want to know that your code is doing what it is supposed to be doing, you first need to understand how the devices you are controlling work. __Electrical is your friend.__ Make friends with some electrical members! They don't bite, I promise (unless, of course, you run a normally 12V battery down to 7V). As a programmer, you will be working closely with Electrical to get the robot ready to run code. Without Electrical, programming can't run their code. Without Programming, the devices Electrical wired can't do anything. You're on a *team*. If every member of Electrical died, you should be able to fill in.
